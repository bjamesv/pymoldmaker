Features:
 1. Corners:
    - ensure enough thickness to cut the corner angles
    - create multiples of pieces as required, so final thicknesses may be built
 up
    implementation:
    a) ensure one side of the joint has sufficient thickness for the corner cut
    b) ensure joint has sufficient combined thickness for a corner cut through 
both pieces

 2. Outer dimensions
    - Produce vector outlines of each piece of the positive for the mold
    - dynamically size each piece according to desired jointing & piece 
thickness
    implementation:
    a) hardcoded size/outlines for each piece
    b) Automated outline detection, via COLLADA model

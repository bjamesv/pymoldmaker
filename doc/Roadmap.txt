PyMoldmaker is being incrementally developed in several small phases.
 - [x] Phase 0 - generate cutlist for one portion of the mold
  - [x] support arbitrary material thicknesses
  - [x] account for kerf of cutting tool in cutlist output
 - [ ] Phase 1 - flexible Cutlist output formats (Human readable, COLLADA, etc.)
  - [ ] confirm parts cut from Phase-0 output match expected dimensions
 - [ ] Phase 2 - automatic generation of all parts
 - [ ] Phase 3 - automatic EPS output
